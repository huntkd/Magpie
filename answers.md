1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds? 
"Go away to" is reponded to with Ok see you later, but "go away" responds with just suf somewhere else. If you ask "where" and it doesn't know the answer it responds with some form of look somewhere else. It responds to "name" with My name is ALICE, but if you put "my name" is responds with whatever you told it your name was.

2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause. 
Why might search for the answer to the question but if the answer is not programmed then it would probably ask a question back.
Tired could cause either a question of why they are tired or tell them to take a nap.
Bye could respond with nice talking to you or goodbye or fine go away.
